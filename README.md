## Project Description

An application which gives information about the current pandemic going
on around in the world that lists the number of cases that are infected,
those that are recovered and number of deaths .Alongwith the number ,this
application also provides a visual representation which makes it more easy
to understand.

This application was built using React (Context, Axios), & Styled Components. I have built the following page within this application from where a user can select the country and it will display the stats for that particular country.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
